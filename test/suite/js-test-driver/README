In order to run js-test-driver, you must have a Java 1.6 runtime available to you (it fails with 1.5)

All commands listed should be run from the root js-test-driver directory

To start the js-test-driver server run:

  java -jar lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.2.jar --port 9876
  
Then, to capture a particular browser, load up http://localhost:9876 in your browser

Click the link "Capture this browser"

Then, start the test client using:

  java -jar lib/JsTestDriver-1.3.2.jar --tests all
  
If you run into any issues, start both server and client with the --runnerMode=DEBUG_NO_TRACE flag to see output errors
